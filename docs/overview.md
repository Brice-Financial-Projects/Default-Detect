# üìä Project Overview: *Default Detect ‚Äî AI-Powered Credit Risk Profiling*

## üß© Problem Statement  
Financial institutions, especially those issuing personal and small business loans, face a high-stakes challenge: **identifying early indicators of loan default** before they become costly liabilities. Traditional credit models are often too rigid or outdated to detect nuanced borrower behaviors, leading to either **missed early warnings** or **denials of credit to viable borrowers**.  

**Default Detect** aims to close that gap using machine learning (ML) and data science to proactively surface risk signals and guide underwriting strategies.

## üì• Data Sources  
We're sourcing a combination of **publicly available and synthetic datasets**, with a priority on datasets that contain:

- Borrower demographics  
- Credit history and utilization  
- Employment and income status  
- Loan details (amount, duration, purpose, etc.)  
- Repayment performance and delinquency timelines  

Potential sources include:  
- **Kaggle**: Open-access financial datasets (e.g., LendingClub data)  
- **UCI Machine Learning Repository**: Classic datasets like German Credit or Statlog  
- **Simulated synthetic data**: For supplementing imbalanced classes or restricted variables

## üß† High-Level Methodology  

Our pipeline will follow a traditional supervised ML workflow with these phases:

1. **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**
   - Handle class imbalance (SMOTE, under-sampling)
   - Normalize or scale variables
   - Derive risk-related features (e.g., debt-to-income ratio, credit age)

2. **Model Training & Evaluation**
   - Logistic Regression (baseline model)
   - Random Forest & XGBoost (nonlinear tree-based models)
   - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
   - *(Optional advanced phase)* Neural networks with regularization

3. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - AUC-ROC  
   - Precision/Recall (with focus on minimizing false negatives)  
   - Confusion Matrix for business interpretation

## üìà Insights from the Data  

The goal is to move beyond binary predictions and provide **early, actionable indicators** such as:

- Borrowers with rising utilization trends before default  
- Behavior clusters linked to late payments  
- Score thresholds that misclassify viable borrowers  

These insights can guide:

- Internal underwriting strategies  
- Risk tier segmentation  
- Proactive borrower outreach or modified repayment structures

## üß™ Statistical Testing & Feature Validation  

To validate and justify key features in our model, we will apply statistical tests during the exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase:

### Chi-Square Test of Independence  
We will assess categorical variables like **employment length** to test whether there's a statistically significant association with default status. For example:

- **Null Hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ):** Employment length and default status are independent  
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ):** Employment length and default status are associated  

A **Chi-Square test** will be performed on a contingency table, and the **degrees of freedom (DoF)** will be calculated as:  
\[
\text{DoF} = (\text{\# employment categories} - 1) \times (\text{\# default categories} - 1)
\]

If p-value < 0.05, we will reject the null hypothesis and retain the feature. Otherwise, we may consider combining or omitting the variable for model simplicity.

This step supports:
- Data-driven **feature selection**
- **Model transparency** for stakeholders
- **Documentation** for reporting and regulatory alignment

## üíµ Cost-Benefit Analysis  

We anticipate a high ROI from early detection:

| Cost Category                  | Estimate              |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Model Training & Tuning       | ~40‚Äì60 hours dev time |
| Cloud Compute & Hosting       | Low ‚Äî using Streamlit and GitHub Pages |
| Data Acquisition              | Mostly open-source    |
| Missed Defaults (avoidance)   | $$$ High potential savings |
| False Denials (reduction)     | $$$ Recovered revenue |

By preventing just a small number of defaults, the model‚Äôs implementation could yield **significant financial savings**, particularly in consumer lending or fintech environments.

## üöÄ Deployment Strategy  

- **Streamlit Web App**  
  The project will be deployed using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) to create an **interactive interface** that allows stakeholders to:
  - Upload new loan applicant data  
  - View risk prediction outcomes  
  - Download reports or summaries  

- **Professional Reporting via GitHub Pages**  
  Alongside the app, we will publish a **fully documented professional report**:
  - Hosted on **GitHub Pages**  
  - Includes executive summary, methodology, findings, and recommendations  
  - Designed for both technical and non-technical stakeholders

## üß† Summary  

*Default Detect* is not just a credit scoring tool ‚Äî it‚Äôs a **risk intelligence platform** powered by data science. By blending robust machine learning with stakeholder-accessible dashboards and clear reporting, we aim to help lenders act **early, wisely, and with confidence**.
